## Project Description
<!-- ![cover](img/) -->

The web map shows the distribution of state's crops, aviation, dairy farms, wineries, people with or without a high school degree, and population by race and gender. These industries have done well to boost Washington's economy. By showing these distributions, it turns out that northwestern Washington is relatively more educated, and most of the factories in these counties are aerospace technology companies, like King County and Snohomish County. Education levels are relatively low in the southeastern part of Washington state, where jobs are mostly in the livestock and farming industries, such as Benton County and Franklin County.

## Goals
For this project, I wanted to explore the relationship between the distribution of workers in Washington State and gender, race, and education. The purpose of this project is to help people understand the distribution of industry in the state of Washington and the underlying factors that contribute to this distribution.
